  "architecture_overview": "The DyLAN codebase appears to structure the framework with a central 'run_DyLAN.py' script for overall execution. Individual LLM agents are likely defined in 'LLM_Neuron.py' and instantiated or managed by a higher-level 'LLMLP.py' or 'CoLLMLP.py' module. This manager handles both the initial agent team optimization (selection based on importance scores) and the subsequent dynamic communication and collaboration among the selected agents. Dataset-specific folders ('MATH', 'MMLU', 'HumanEval') then adapt and apply this core DyLAN logic for their respective tasks and evaluations."
