The core implementation is expected in `tensor2tensor/models/transformer.py`. This file defines the overall encoder-decoder structure. Foundational components like Multi-Head Attention and Positional Encodings (called 'timing signals') are implemented as reusable functions in a shared location, likely `tensor2tensor/layers/common_attention.py`. The model's behavior is controlled by a `HParams` object, and it's trained, evaluated, and used for inference via command-line scripts like `t2t_trainer.py` and `t2t_decoder.py`."
