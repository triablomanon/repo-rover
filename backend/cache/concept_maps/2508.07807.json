Data handling is managed by the `data/` directory, where `data/loaders.py` fetches the benchmark data, and `data/featurize.py` and `data/polyatomic_featurize.py` create the standard and topological features, respectively. The core GNN model, likely named `PolyatomicModel` or `PACTNet`, is defined in `models/polyatomic.py` and utilizes base GNN layers from `models/gnn.py`. The `training/` directory contains the logic for the training/evaluation loop, which is called by a high-level `runners.py` script to execute the full experiment."
