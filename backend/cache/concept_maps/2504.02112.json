  "architecture_overview": "The codebase implements a general GraphRAG system, which aligns with the foundational concept of the paper. However, there is a significant divergence in the core contribution. The paper 'PolyG' proposes a 'query planner' that first classifies a question and then selects an adaptive traversal strategy. The 'fast-graphrag' codebase does not appear to implement this classification or adaptive traversal. Instead, its README explicitly mentions a single, fixed traversal method: 'PageRank-based graph exploration'. Therefore, the code represents a different, non-adaptive GraphRAG architecture rather than a direct implementation of the PolyG system."
