# Latest Update: Simplified to Use Only New Gemini SDK

## What Was Fixed

Previously, when you ran `python test_individual.py gemini`, the answers were completely irrelevant because the test was using dummy code and not integrating with:
- Vectara search (to find relevant code snippets)
- Paper PDF (to understand the theory)

## What Changed

### 1. Completely rewrote `gemini_synthesizer.py` to use ONLY the new SDK

**Removed**: Old `google-generativeai` SDK
**Now using**: Only `google-genai` SDK for everything

**Key changes**:
- Import: `from google import genai` and `from google.genai import types`
- Single client: `self.client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)` created in `__init__`
- All methods now use: `self.client.models.generate_content(model=self.model_name, contents=...)`
- PDF support: Uses `types.Part.from_bytes()` for multimodal API

**Updated all 5 methods**:
1. `create_concept_map()` - Uses new SDK
2. `explain_code_concept()` - Uses new SDK
3. `answer_question()` - Uses new SDK with PDF support
4. `generate_minimal_example()` - Uses new SDK
5. All fallback cases - Uses new SDK

### 2. Created `test_query()` in `test_individual.py`

New interactive test that runs the FULL pipeline:
1. Get corpus from Vectara
2. Download paper and PDF
3. Find GitHub repository
4. Clone repository
5. Index code into Vectara
6. Ask YOU for a question
7. Search Vectara for relevant code
8. Send to Gemini with PDF + code
9. Return answer

## How to Test

### Step 1: Update your conda environment (REQUIRED!)
```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

This will install **only** `google-genai>=0.2.0` (removed the old SDK)

### Step 2: Run the new query test
```bash
python test_individual.py query
```

### What You'll See

```
[1/6] Getting corpus...
✓ Corpus ID: 12345

[2/6] Getting paper and PDF...
✓ PDF: arxiv_papers/2310.02170.pdf

[3/6] Getting repository...
✓ Repo: https://github.com/username/repo

[4/6] Cloning repository...
✓ Cloned to: cloned_repos/repo

[5/6] Indexing code (this may take a minute)...
✓ Indexed 45 files

[6/6] Initializing query pipeline...

======================================================================
ASK YOUR QUESTION
======================================================================

The pipeline will:
  1. Search Vectara for relevant code snippets
  2. Provide Gemini with: PDF + code + your question
  3. Return an answer connecting paper theory to code

Your question: _
```

### Step 3: Ask your question

Try questions like:
- "What is the main contribution of this paper?"
- "How is the attention mechanism implemented?"
- "Explain the key algorithm in the code"
- "What datasets are used?"

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Vectara search**: Your question is used to find the most relevant code snippets from the indexed repository
2. **PDF loading**: The paper PDF is loaded as bytes
3. **Gemini synthesis**: Gemini receives:
   - The paper PDF (full context)
   - Relevant code snippets (from Vectara)
   - Your question
4. **Answer generation**: Gemini connects theory (from PDF) to practice (from code)

## Expected Results

You should now get **relevant answers** that:
- Reference specific parts of the paper
- Show how concepts are implemented in code
- Connect theory to practice
- Cite both the paper and code

## If Answers Are Still Not Good

If answers are still irrelevant or low quality, we can:
1. Adjust the Gemini prompt (lines 186-199 in `gemini_synthesizer.py`)
2. Increase the number of code snippets from Vectara
3. Improve the search query to Vectara
4. Add more context to the prompt

## Files Modified

1. **src/understanding/gemini_synthesizer.py** (lines 159-255)
   - Updated `answer_question()` to use PDF context
   - Added multimodal API integration

2. **test_individual.py** (lines 116-213)
   - Added `test_query()` function
   - Full 6-step pipeline with interactive questions

## Next Steps

1. Run `python test_individual.py query`
2. Ask a few different questions
3. Evaluate answer quality
4. Let me know if adjustments are needed!
